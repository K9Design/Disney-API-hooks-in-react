# The World of Disney React App

## A disney react challenge

A react app that calls upon the [disneyapi.dev](http://www.disneyapi.dev) to fetch data on disney characters. You can see pages of them as well select your favourites and have them compiled into a single page.

Methods used are Axios for data retrival.
React hooks useState(), useEffect(), useContext() and custom hooks useFavourites() / useToggleFavourites() in FavouriteContext.js for state and data management.
